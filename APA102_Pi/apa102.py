    Driver for APA102 LEDS (aka "DotStar").

    Public methods are:
     - set_pixel
     - set_pixel_rgb
     - show
     - clear_strip
     - cleanup

    Helper methods for color manipulation are:
     - combine_color
     - wheel

    The rest of the methods are used internally and should not be used by the
    user of the library.

    Very brief overview of APA102: An APA102 LED is addressed with SPI. The bits
    are shifted in one by one, starting with the least significant bit.

    An LED usually just forwards everything that is sent to its data-in to
    data-out. While doing this, it remembers its own color and keeps glowing
    with that color as long as there is power.

    An LED can be switched to not forward the data, but instead use the data
    to change it's own color. This is done by sending (at least) 32 bits of
    zeroes to data-in. The LED then accepts the next correct 32 bit LED
    frame (with color information) as its new color setting.

    After having received the 32 bit color frame, the LED changes color,
    and then resumes to just copying data-in to data-out.

    The really clever bit is this: While receiving the 32 bit LED frame,
    the LED sends zeroes on its data-out line. Because a color frame is
    32 bits, the LED sends 32 bits of zeroes to the next LED.
    As we have seen above, this means that the next LED is now ready
    to accept a color frame and update its color.

    So that's really the entire protocol:
    - Start by sending 32 bits of zeroes. This prepares LED 1 to update
      its color.
    - Send color information one by one, starting with the color for LED 1,
      then LED 2 etc.
    - Finish off by cycling the clock line a few times to get all data
      to the very last LED on the strip

    The last step is necessary, because each LED delays forwarding the data
    a bit. Imagine ten people in a row. When you yell the last color
    information, i.e. the one for person ten, to the first person in
    the line, then you are not finished yet. Person one has to turn around
    and yell it to person 2, and so on. So it takes ten additional "dummy"
    cycles until person ten knows the color. When you look closer,
    you will see that not even person 9 knows its own color yet. This
    information is still with person 2. Essentially the driver sends additional
    zeroes to LED 1 as long as it takes for the last color frame to make it
    down the line to the last LED.

    Params:
      led_order - If set, allow the use of a logical order that doesn't match
        the physical strip given as a sequence of (first, last) ranges. As a
        compex example, if your strips were connected as:
        5-6-7-8-0-1-2-3-12-11-10-9
        then you could set led_order=((5, 8), (0, 3), (12, 9))
        Tip: runcolorcycle.py can be useful to verify you have these values correct.

        As explained above, dummy data must be sent after the last real colour
        information so that all of the data can reach its destination down the line.
        The delay is not as bad as with the human example above.
        It is only 1/2 bit per LED. This is because the SPI clock line
        needs to be inverted.

        Say a bit is ready on the SPI data line. The sender communicates
        this by toggling the clock line. The bit is read by the LED
        and immediately forwarded to the output data line. When the clock goes
        down again on the input side, the LED will toggle the clock up
        on the output to tell the next LED that the bit is ready.

        After one LED the clock is inverted, and after two LEDs it is in sync
        again, but one cycle behind. Therefore, for every two LEDs, one bit
        of delay gets accumulated. For 300 LEDs, 150 additional bits must be fed to
        the input of LED one so that the data can reach the last LED.

        Ultimately, we need to send additional numLEDs/2 arbitrary data bits,
        in order to trigger numLEDs/2 additional clock changes. This driver
        sends zeroes, which has the benefit of getting LED one partially or
        fully ready for the next update to the strip. An optimized version
        of the driver could omit the "clockStartFrame" method if enough zeroes have
        been sent as part of "clockEndFrame".
